# Spotify Streaming Analytics

A lightweight Streamlit app that recreates and extends Spotify Wrapped using raw Spotify listening history.

Built to see full year stats and look back at past years (Spotify stops tracking in November and hides historical data)

Users can upload their “Extended Streaming History” JSON files from Spotify to explore full-year, historical, and all-time listening patterns.

The project is intentionally simple and transparent — metrics are calculated in plain Python with no black-box logic and no data is stored beyond the active session.

Tools: Python (pandas, Plotly, Streamlit)

Live app: (https://spotifywrappedcomplete.streamlit.app/)
